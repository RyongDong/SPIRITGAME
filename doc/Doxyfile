# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file 
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all 
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the 
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See 
# http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv for the list of possible encodings.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = Bitcoin

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 0.5.0

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description 
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer 
# a quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "P2P Digital Currency"
