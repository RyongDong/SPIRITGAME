TOR SUPPORT IN BITCOIN
======================

It is possible to run Bitcoin as a Tor hidden service, and connect to such services.

The following assumes you have a Tor proxy running on port 9050. Many distributions
default to having a SOCKS proxy listening on port 9050, but others may not.
In particular, the Tor Browser Bundle defaults to listening on a random port. See
https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBSocksPort for how to properly
configure Tor.


1. Run bitcoin behind a Tor proxy
---------------------------------

The first step is running Bitcoin behind a Tor proxy. This will already make all
outgoing connections be anonimized, but more is possible.

-socks=5        SOCKS5 supports connecting-to-hostname, which can be used instead
                of doing a (leaking) local DNS lookup. SOCKS5 is the default,
                but SOCKS4 does not support this. (SOCKS4a does, but isn't
                implemented).

-proxy=ip:port  Set the proxy server. If SOCKS5 is selected (default), this proxy
                server will be used to try to reach .onion addresses as well.

-tor=ip:port    Set the proxy server to use for tor hidden services. You do not
                need to set this if it's the same as -proxy. You can use -notor
                to explicitly disable access to hidden service.

-dnsseed        DNS seeds are not resolved directly when a SOCKS5 proxy server is
                set. Rather, a short-lived proxy connection to the dns seed
                hostname is attempted, and peer addresses are requested.

-listen         When using -proxy, listening is disabled by default. If you want
                to run a hidden service (see next section), you'll need to enable
                it explicitly.

-connect=X      When behind a Tor proxy, you can specify .onion addresses instead
-addnode=X      of IP addresses or hostnames in these parameters. It requires
-seednode=X     SOCKS5. In Tor mode, such addresses can also be exchanged with
                other P2P nodes.

In a typical situation, this suffices to run behind a Tor proxy:

  ./bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050


2. Run a bitcoin hidden server
------------------------------

If you configure your Tor system accordingly, it is possible to make your node also
reachable from the Tor network. Add these lines to your /etc/tor/torrc (or equivalent
config file):

  HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor
